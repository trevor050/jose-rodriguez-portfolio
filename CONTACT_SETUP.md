# Contact Form Setup Guide - Discord Webhook Solution

**Current solution:** Discord webhook for instant notifications (zero email service drama!)

## Current Setup - Discord Webhook (Recommended)

âœ… **Instant notifications** in Discord  
âœ… **Zero email service signups** required  
âœ… **Webhook URL hidden** on backend (secure)  
âœ… **Professional formatting** with embeds  
âœ… **Free forever** (Discord doesn't charge for webhooks)  

### Quick Setup (Already Done!)

1. **Discord webhook created** âœ…
2. **Backend updated** to use Discord âœ…  
3. **Frontend security** - webhook URL never exposed âœ…

**To activate:** Add your webhook URL(s) to Vercel environment variables (do not commit real URLs):

```
DISCORD_MAIN_WEBHOOK=your_main_channel_webhook_url
DISCORD_SPAM_WEBHOOK=your_spam_channel_webhook_url
```

## Security Features

ðŸ”’ **Webhook URL hidden** - Only backend knows the URL  
ðŸ”’ **Rate limiting** - Built-in spam protection  
ðŸ”’ **Input validation** - All data sanitized  
ðŸ”’ **Honeypot detection** - Catches bots silently  

**No one can spam your Discord directly** - they'd have to spam through your contact form (which has protection).

## What You Get

**Discord message format:**
```
ðŸ”§ New Portfolio Contact!

ðŸ‘¤ Name: Sarah Johnson
ðŸ“§ Email: sarah@college.edu

## Backup Email Options (If Needed)

Discord webhook is the primary system, but you can still add email services:

### Gmail SMTP (Still Recommended as Backup)
1. Enable 2FA on your Gmail account
2. Generate an App Password  
3. Add to Vercel environment variables:
   ```
   GMAIL_USER=jose.rodriguez.engineer@gmail.com
   GMAIL_PASS=your_16_character_app_password
   TO_EMAIL=jose.rodriguez.engineer@gmail.com
   ```

### Other Email Services (When They Unban You)
- **SendGrid:** Now $30/month (no longer recommended)
- **Resend:** 3000 emails/month free (if they don't auto-suspend)  
- **Mailgun/Mailjet:** Contact their support teams

1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
