# üì∏ Assets Required for Jose's Engineering Portfolio

## Image Requirements

Please add these project images to complete the portfolio:

### Project Images (`/public/assets/images/`)

1. **`cardboard-engine.jpg`**
   - High-quality photo of the cardboard 4-cylinder engine
   - Recommended size: 800x600 or higher
   - Should show detail and craftsmanship
   - Good lighting to highlight the engineering work

2. **`crossbow.jpg`**
   - Photo of the rubber band crossbow
   - Show the mechanical components clearly
   - Demonstrate the engineering precision
   - Action shot or detail shot both work

3. **`cardboard-armor.jpg`**
   - Full shot of the wearable cardboard armor
   - Could be worn or displayed
   - Show the structural engineering aspects
   - Multiple angles if possible

4. **`jeans-project.jpg`**
   - Photo of the custom-tailored jeans
   - Highlight the precision stitching
   - Show the engineering approach to garment construction
   - Detail shots of reinforced areas would be great

## Optional Enhancement Images

### Icons (`/public/assets/icons/`)
- Engineering-themed icons (gears, blueprints, tools)
- Project category icons
- Status indicators

### Textures (`/public/assets/textures/`)
- Blueprint backgrounds
- Engineering paper textures
- Metal/industrial textures for visual enhancement

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: Minimum 800x600, prefer 1200x900 or higher
- **Quality**: High resolution, well-lit
- **Style**: Professional but showing personality
- **Content**: Focus on the engineering aspects and craftsmanship

## Current Fallback

Until real images are added, the site shows:
- Engineering-themed gradient backgrounds
- Gear emoji (‚öôÔ∏è) as placeholders
- Professional color schemes that match the engineering theme

## Adding Images

1. Drop image files into `/public/assets/images/`
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. The website will automatically load them
4. No code changes needed!

*The portfolio is fully functional with placeholders, but adding real project photos will make it absolutely stellar for college applications! üöÄ*
